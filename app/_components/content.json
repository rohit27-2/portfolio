    "bio": "In 2022, I graduated as a frontend developer at Coderhouse while also studying Biological Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires. That same year, my partner and I decided to move to Spain, so I had to temporarily leave my university studies to live here. I have one year of experience creating responsive websites, and I currently work as a freelancer. Along this journey, I realized my passion for UX/UI design, so now I'm studying in this area to complement my design skills with development.",
